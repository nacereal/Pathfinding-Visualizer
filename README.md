# Pathfinding Visualizer
## About
A web-based pathfinding algorithm visualizer.

Current included algorithm(s):
 * Dijkstra's algorithm
 * A* (soonâ„¢)

As of now, touchscreen does not work with this. This was only intended to work with a PC, but who knows, I might end up adding support.

## Usage

Hold middle mouse button and move mouse to move around the canvas.

When placing any tile:
 - Left click to place a single tile
 - Right click to remove a single tile
 - For walls and weights, hold left click to place multiple tiles and hold right click to remove multiple tiles

Press play and watch the algorithm do its work. Try it out [here](http://naseers-pathfinder.herokuapp.com/) (takes a second to boot up).
