# Pathfinding Visualizer
## About
This is a web-based pathfinding algorithm visualizer which will (hopefully) include a lot of popular pathfinding algorithms.

Current included algorithm(s):
 * Dijkstra's algorithm
 * A* (soonâ„¢)

As of now, touchscreen does not work with this. This was only intended to work with a PC, but who knows, I might end up adding support.
