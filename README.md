# Pathfinding Visualizer
## About
This is a web-based pathfinding algorithm visualizer which will (hopefully) include a lot of popular pathfinding algorithms.

Current included algorithm(s):
 * Dijkstra's algorithm
 * A* (soonâ„¢)

As of now, touchscreen does not work with this. This was only intended to work with a PC, but who knows, I might end up adding support.

## Usage

Hold middle mouse button and move mouse to move around the canvas.

When placing any tile:
 - Left click to place a single tile
 - Right click to remove a single tile
 - For walls and weights, hold left click to place multiple tiles and hold right click to remove multiple tiles

Press play and watch the algorithm do its work
